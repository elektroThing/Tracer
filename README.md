- **Real-time 3D Visualization:** Stream data via UART to a script on [Processing](https://github.com/processing) for a 3D visual experience. Watch the demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6d10yX7fZ4).
  
- **Stream to Phyphox:** Directly stream IMU plots over BLE to your phone. Export data as CSV for in-depth analysis, showcasing Tracer's capability to track accelerometer data and tennis ball strikes. Check out the live demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZTHZ-QFxR4).

- **Gesture Recognition with Edge Impulse:** Highlighting Tracer's adaptability, the Edge Impulse platform can be employed to train a neural network. This network operates natively on the ESP32, tracking specific gestures or activities. See it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU7HlFeuip4).

## How to Run the Demo Script

1. **Setup:** Ensure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
2. **Connect:** Plug in your ESP32-C3 device to your computer via USB.
3. **Integrated JTAG:** Ensure the JTAG is setup. In Tools, "USB CDC On Boot" is Enabled and JTAG Adapter is USB JTAG Adapter.
5. **Load Script:** Open one of the demo script provided in the Arduino IDE.
6. **Select Board:** From the 'Tools' menu, select 'Board' and choose 'ESP32-C3'.
7. **Select Port:** Select the port for the Tracer device, if nothing pops up, unplug the device, hold the settings button and plug it back into the computer while still holding the button. It should appear now.
8. **Upload:** Click on the 'Upload' button to program the ESP32-C3.
9. **Monitor:** Open the Serial Monitor to view outputs and ensure the script runs successfully.
